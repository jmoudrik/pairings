# pairings

A webapp tool for generation of **[Tournament Pairing Result Forms (example)](./example.pdf)** for the game of Go. A public instance is running **[here](http://gostyle.j2m.cz/pairings)!**


The winning player can encircle his victory, sign (both players) and put the form into a result box. This can greatly reduce the number of invalid results
in tournaments. The usual method of encircling on the pairing paper gets impractical for large tournaments.


Currently, the only supported file format is the export of [Christhoph Gerlach's Macmahon pairing application](http://www.cgerlach.de/go/macmahon.html).
